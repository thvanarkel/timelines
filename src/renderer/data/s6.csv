4,0:06:38,,"But basically two are about time, and one is the action.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
5,0:06:46,,So we're designing for the bullies.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
6,0:06:48,Yeah,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
7,0:06:52,,[reading brief] important that they stop their continuous offensive expressions.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
8,0:06:56,The first thing that comes to my mind is that what happens if someone bullies the one that bullies…,,regression2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
9,0:07:03,,No but isn't that a [makes circular gesture in the air]. Like you shame me I shame you.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
10,0:07:14,,Oke let's.. [writes down bullying on paper],,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
11,0:07:26,,So we said insult..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
12,0:07:33,"Yeah it can be oral, or it can be with like hand jobs..",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
13,0:07:53,,It always kind of happens in a group dynamic.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
14,0:08:02,And probably there is some followers of the guy that bullies.,,manipulation1,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
15,0:08:08,,"So it's group dynamic in the sense of, like the bully is supported.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
16,0:08:18,Like he or she has more followers probably.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
17,0:08:24,,"But also what I'm saying is it's more rare I think, which is an assumption, that if you put two kids in one room that they are going to bully each other, than if you put fifteen in one room.",manipulation1,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
18,0:08:42,Yeah so number of children in the group.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
19,0:08:49,,Then here [points at brief] it says repeatedly so that means that you kind of need to have a routine. That allows that bullying.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
20,0:08:58,"Yeah so maybe the breaks, after school.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
21,0:09:07,,"Then what he was saying was the difference books, that he had something that was different from the others.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
22,0:09:21,The bacteria thing?,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
23,0:09:23,,"Oh no the book, the dyscalculia. That basically was a different book so that was a a reason to bully him.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
24,0:09:29,So a different characteristic,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
25,0:09:31,,Yeah so it is like when you spot something… you understand what I mean right..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
26,0:09:43,"Yeah so like a different kind of characteristic, in this case it's like a skill thing, but next time it was about transmitting bacteria.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
27,0:09:54,,Yeah so basically it's like you vs other.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

29,0:10:34,,"So we don't need to teach the guy how to defend himself, we just need to make them stop basically..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
30,0:10:47,"What comes to my mind from these different characteristics.. Because that's the reason that they start bullying, and probably they are like less powerful, less picking than the other ones, that's probably why they are getting bullied.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
31,0:11:04,"If we, maybe I'm thinking to solution-oriented haha, but if we let them exist with their differences in the same environment..",,proposition2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
32,0:11:15,or show them that diffferences are not bad persé.,,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year

37,0:11:59,,"You probably like the fact that you feel empowered, you make people laugh so you're the center of attention.",regression1,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
38,0:12:16,,"Then you kind of provoke a reaction, and that's what you want.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
39,0:12:24,,"You kind of also want to shift the focus, because if I make fun of you people are going to look at you, they are not going to look at me while I bully you. So there is a shifting of focus.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
40,0:12:44,,"So I don't expose myself basically, like it's way also to not be on the frontline. You know what I mean?",manipulation1,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
41,0:12:51,,So that's probably also a problem.. I don't know cause some people are just assholes. But maybe it's also a matter of like…,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
42,0:13:04,,Did you have any experience that you could think of?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
43,0:13:07,Yeah when I was in the elementary school there were a lot of friends of mine who were bullying a girl.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
44,0:13:16,,Do you remember which topics they were bullying about?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
45,0:13:23,"Not really, because of her appearance.. Because she was not good at the lessons. She had a hard time understanding stuff.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
46,0:13:33,,So appearance,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
47,0:13:35,And learning capabilities.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
48,0:13:44,,"The gym/sports stuff, basically it's all about the sport like thing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

50,0:14:04,Aah you were bullying people. Why?,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
51,0:14:10,,"Not like mean bullying, but I was kind of in between.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
52,0:14:16,Like making fun of people? Because you were the cool guys?,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
53,0:14:19,,"Yeah we were. It's kind of funny because there was this stairs stuff, the field for playing.. And there were like stairs and we could sit, like the girls were sitting on the stairs and that was our spot, but we were like eight or nine.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
54,0:14:41,,"So I don't know exactly, but I wasn't really bullying bullying, I think it was ignoring the fact that people were bullied.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
55,0:14:50,"Or ignoring that other people… but I think here it's more about doing physical, really bad stuff.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
56,0:15:01,,"I think one way is to, but it's a solution-oriented..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
57,0:15:06,But it's good to have those..,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
58,0:15:10,,So it's kind of like make smaller groups..,proposition2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
59,0:15:14,Yeah oke.. Maybe smaller groups with similar interests.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
60,0:15:21,,I don't really like the idea of dividing kids already when they are young. I know that in some cultures it's kind of normal that you are already into some kind of path when you are already young. But I don't think that is good because what if after five years you wanna like...,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
61,0:15:39,Yeah but then what do you mean making smaller groups?,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
62,0:15:43,,"Its [inaudible] … But of course if the client is the government it's impossible because it needs more money, because smaller groups you need more teachers.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
63,0:15:49,You mean like class-wise.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
64,0:15:52,,"Yeah I mean imagine that in the gym in your class instead of being twenty, you are seven..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
65,0:16:02,,"If there is a bully thing the teacher spots it way more easier, and it's even more difficult because at one point you will get in contact with that person.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
66,0:16:12,"But I think like this making smaller groups it not necessarily that they have to be in smaller classes, but we can kind of come up with something that would let them choose to hangout in smaller groups.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
67,0:16:32,"It's not necessarily the physical space that they can be in, but more..",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
68,0:16:39,,Like a buddy situation..,proposition2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
69,0:16:41,,Like that you have a buddy for a week..,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
70,0:16:43,Yeah something like that.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
71,0:16:45,,"And the buddies are shifted, so basically you…",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
72,0:16:54,,But then I wouldn't think that that eliminates the bullying…,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
73,0:16:58,Yeah it's just something that comes to my mind from this making smaller groups.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
74,0:17:09,,"The thing is like I don't even know how the school is done here, like I know how it's done in Italy, I can draw like a timeline of how a person.. The steps of a kid entering the school. But it's probably very different from yours as well.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
75,0:17:25,"Yeah, if you want we can go from Italy.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
76,0:17:29,,"Like in my thing it's fixed, we are always the same people in class. It's not like you do french with other people, and maths with others.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
77,0:17:41,,"So you have one class, and you are always stuck together. From I don't know, 8:30 or something. And then you have one break, say at 11:00.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
78,0:17:53,,"And then you have lunch, sometimes you stay after lunch sometimes you don't. But like when you stay after lunch then you have the big break and then you have classes you go around 16:30.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
79,0:18:09,,"So it's really basically what you have, and you always stay in the same location. And you don't change the location.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
80,0:18:19,,So I think this is not good.. That you don't change the location.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
81,0:18:31,,"Like you in a way the time it takes you to change location from one to another is a small break, so but you can't like not give a break to people because otherwise they bully each other.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
82,0:18:44,,But the thing is like if the bullying is like repeated and over a longer period of time [points at design brief] that means it's kind of like a routine.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
83,0:18:54,,"So maybe if you kind of break the routine, so the place is different then maybe there is more opportunity to break the kind of patterns.",regression2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
84,0:19:05,Yeah it can be a way. So..,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
85,0:19:14,"But then is it like going to different classes, going to different rooms for different classes?",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
86,0:19:21,,No I'm thinking even inside the room. You know this kind of dynamic tables that you roll over and then you are sitting with one person and then you can rollover.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
87,0:19:35,,"And if you kind of like encourage that it means that you don't have one person you are sitting with for the whole day, but maybe at the end of the day you have seated with all of them.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
88,0:19:46,"Yeah okay that is nice, then maybe if it's the idea that they kind of fit to each others tables, then maybe they can do something together.",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
89,0:20:02,"Because these might the ones who actually don't know each other that well, but if at the end if they come together maybe four of them, if they create something together and then take it home.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
90,0:20:15,"Or maybe it is at the end of the week you get a small piece of every day that you are sitting together, and then you collect different pieces…",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
91,0:20:27,"Because I also like the idea that they have differences, like different characteristics and that is the thing that make other people bully them.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
92,0:20:37,"But if you get that difference and then make something out of it for yourselve, then you can't bully because it somehow becomes your part as well.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
93,0:20:46,,That's very holistic..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
94,0:20:59,Yeah I like this idea.. Of moving patterns and then also making something with it.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
95,0:21:12,,"The problem is, I'm thinking of, I'm arriving to class my teacher told me to sit here so I understand that I'm gonna be with the dirty guy in the group.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
96,0:21:24,,"I'm already pissed off, 'omg I have to sit next to him', so that guy will feel awful so then we have to turn and have to start playing and then I'm like 'no I don't want to play with you'. You know what I mean?",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
97,0:21:38,,So how do you… The problem for me is the group dynamic.,transformation1,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
98,0:21:48,,"Because you probably leave these people.. Like you know, in a space where you have to…",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
99,0:21:57,,Like the kind of activities would you make them do on here?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
100,0:22:06,It can be like a regular assignment that the teacher gives.,,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
101,0:22:13,,Like history stuff?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
102,0:22:15,"Uhu, like making maquettes or …",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
103,0:22:22,,I don't even remember what you did in elementary school,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
104,0:22:34,,"Cause this thing, you know those kinds of games that you are doing and you need to pick a name from a ball and then it's like couple of things and then you need to find your buddy that put the same thing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
105,0:22:58,,"So that it is kind of like a game and you exclude this 'no-one wanted to pick me, I was alone'.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
106,0:23:05,,"So I don't know, it's kind of like you can't leave them choosing, because that gives room to…",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
107,0:23:17,,But then we are not really tackling the problem.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
108,0:23:22,Yeah we're kind of doubting that if we force those children sit next to each other they will keep doing the same thing.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
109,0:23:33,"So it should be something somehow voluntary, they want to do that.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
110,0:23:44,,"Ok, let's throw ideas, we have half an hour. Let's throw ideas out and then we see what like whatever, how it will go.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
111,0:24:04,,"Because there are two, I see it in this way. There are like two big boxes or whatever, one is to stop and one is informative.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
112,0:24:20,,So we kind of need to understand what are the drivers of the problem.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
113,0:24:28,,"So one thing is to change, our goal is to make them change their behaviour.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
114,0:24:35,,"So you either inform them and make them understand that it is wrong, which of course is the good thing in the long-term. But it's more hard.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
115,0:24:43,,Or you create them from stop acting in that way and I think that this is also good in the long-term because probably if you don't see it you won't do it.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
116,0:24:56,"Yeah, but I think [the informing] can be integrated into [stopping] because how to let them stop, you have to give some input to make them stop.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
117,0:25:06,You cannot give some information about that it is bad..,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
118,0:25:11,,But they know that..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
119,0:25:13,Yeah but then they don't see it.. That they do it.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
120,0:25:18,Let's do some braindumps and then kind of explain to each other what we came up with.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
121,0:25:25,Or we can also do I draw something and then pass it to you and then you draw something.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
122,0:25:28,,Yeah i don't know…,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

127,0:26:02,,"No, go crazy!",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

148,0:30:28,"So there should be some kind of database, like a difference-database",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
149,0:30:35,,"I don't think we had folders of kids, it's not like America where people have folders of kids at school.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
150,0:30:48,,"But kind of from something like that, so you collect all the info from the child",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
151,0:30:53,"You can also ask them right, so we can make like a wall, like a 'our differences' wall so they can say like I have this",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
152,0:31:03,"Like they can also give the input, the children themselves.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
153,0:31:08,And it also enables them not to be ashamed of their differences.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
154,0:31:16,,So it's entering the class which probably also happens when you leave the class for the break.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
155,0:31:29,,"But I think it should be also, can then be some sort of game.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
156,0:31:38,,"Like for example seeing yourselve, but if you need to make activities that can be longer and everyone has a different differences.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
157,0:31:51,"Oke so maybe from the previous day I choose, or from the previous week you choose 'I want to be [C.]'",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
158,0:31:55,,"And then you have to, or if you have to choose then we recreate the pattern of the gym, so probably it needs to be assigned to you.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
159,0:32:04,,"The first time, because otherwise it's gonna be like 'no one picked me' you know.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
160,0:32:10,,"But yeah, so experience the difference basically.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

162,0:32:23,And everyone is different so…,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
163,0:32:25,,And probably also the teachers need to do it.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
164,0:32:30,,"Because I think that this idea of like, it's a power dynamic you know.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
165,0:32:39,,"So if I already have another power dynamic in the classroom, you know what I mean?",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
166,0:32:46,,"I think it's matter of, I really hate that because I really like hierarchy, but of I remove that hierarchy maybe that also helps in creating hierarchy between kids.",regression2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
167,0:33:02,,"So if the teacher kind of participates in this kind of thing, so it's not humiliating to do it.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

169,0:33:16,Then the teacher is also part of the space.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
170,0:33:20,"I think it is a good one, because maybe the teacher also writes to that difference-wall. 'Guys I have a …' something like that.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
171,0:33:50,,[while writing] 'Everyone participates!',,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

173,0:34:13,,"…and gives your role, but it's like an activitiy that goes on through the week.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
174,0:34:22,,"Because then I have like a wall with all the differences written, then we discuss it…",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
175,0:34:30,,"and we also maybe learn about what it is, because I feel a big thing is that you don't know what it is, so you make fun of it.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
176,0:34:38,"But how do we imagine, so I come to the school and then in the wall what do I see?",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
177,0:34:50,,"I don't know, all words that kids put on, and then you kind of like take those as points of research.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
178,0:35:02,,"So then it's going to be like fifteen minutes, I don't know how long classes are for these kids, but imagine like fifteen or twenty minutes that you go into some of the difference and you understand what is dyslexia for example.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
179,0:35:16,,And then I bring you examples of like really cool people that have dyslexia and what they can do.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
180,0:35:24,,"So basically you start learning without saying it's that kid, probably the class knows. Kind of like getting people to know what's going on.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
181,0:35:34,,But not in the way that I'm imposing it but they trigger with getting up with the topics.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
182,0:35:40,"Now I just don't see the connection with the wall, where we wrote down all the stuff, and then is it like one day I see a characteristic on the door or I see multiple characteristics per day? Or how does it work?",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
183,0:35:55,I think it's nice if the door would random select from the wall.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
184,0:36:04,,And do you think it should be for all the kids the same or every kid should have a different one.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
185,0:36:16,Per day you mean?,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
186,0:36:17,,"Like is today, or for three days, everyone experiences dyslexia. Or I experience that, you experience not having a hand or blablabla.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
187,0:36:27,"Maybe you form some groups, because that was also the idea so that you don't feel alone in being like dyslexia on your own that day. But you have someone to share with.",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
188,0:36:42,,"Or maybe you do, you have this thing around [points at wall], you do research, you explain what it is. And then there is like a VR game in which I need to complete tasks but my character has specific difficulties or differences.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
189,0:37:02,,"So basically I need to also remember what we said in class and in order to complete the game to win, I need to overcome my problems.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
190,0:37:14,The problems of..,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
191,0:37:16,,Of the things that you wrote on the wall.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
192,0:37:19,Of the dyslexic for instance.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
193,0:37:22,,"Yeah it can be of the dyslexic, or I don't know it can be many different things.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
194,0:37:27,,"And it's a game like a videogame or whatever, I don't know. So in Virtual Reality and if I don't have hand or if I'm chubby.. At one point there is a problem which I need to like fit in to something and I'm super fat so I can't fit into something so I need to find another solution.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
195,0:37:45,,"So it makes it into a game, I'm the character that is fat and smelly.. So it's kind of a game thing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
196,0:37:55,,"But it's also to learn because it's in order to know what, so not the fat thing but the dyslexia thing, I need to remember that there is a supporting teacher and ask her to do something for me.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
197,0:38:12,,And that also informs the actual people with the problem on how to overcome the problem.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
198,0:38:28,So is it like a game that those children play when they have a break.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
199,0:38:37,,"Well they also have to be free… I mean maybe, I don't think they actually study six hours a day. So it's probably gonna be all activities, like fun, and then one of those is the game.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
200,0:38:50,"In my elementary school we had this like IDE academy, we had something like that in our elementary school",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
201,0:38:59,,I have no memories..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
202,0:39:01,"Yeah now I do, it was like perosnal development kind of thing.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
203,0:39:08,Maybe it can be implemented like a once per week thing,,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
204,0:39:15,,"Yeah or every two weeks, because there has to be this pressing thing, otherwise it is creepy.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
205,0:39:19,"Then ok, I also think that in this.. How I feel is that if I become like a chubby guy, then for instance I cannot pass through a gate because I'm too big. Then what do I do?",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
206,0:39:37,,"Maybe there is some butter there and you can squeeze yourselve in, or you need to ask two other friends to push you. I don't know, every little context needs to be thought of.",manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
207,0:39:52,How I'm thinking is that it's not that the characteristics should not discourage you…,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
208,0:40:06,"So there is a hole maybe, and let's take chubby guy, so it's too big. And there's also like a whole and water comes out",,manipulation2,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
209,0:40:22,,And you need a lot of water to come out.. To succeed in the thing. So if you are the chubby guy and jump in the water than you make way more water coming out.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
210,0:40:32,"I was thinking like you have to cover the hole, with the chubby guy.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
211,0:40:36,,So basically you accomplish through..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
212,0:40:49,"through your difference, using your difference. You make a contribution to the game.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
213,0:41:00,,"So you actually win, so it's always positive.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
214,0:41:21,,With the teacher as well?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
215,0:41:23,Yeah yeah!,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
216,0:41:25,,It's good in order to lower the hierarchy you know.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
217,0:41:28,It's also nice to see that someone who is older also has a difference.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
218,0:41:50,,"So this kind of informs you because you actually learn. Plus you have [the game], but of course the kids chose [the differences].",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
219,0:42:04,"And it's also voluntary, it depends on the children what to write and what not to write.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
220,0:42:12,,So it's kind of like what they have in mind and what is bugging them.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
221,0:42:15,,And then..,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
222,0:42:17,"Yeah I think this game can be anything, it doesn't have to be a VR thing, it can also be like a cards, like scenarios.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
223,0:42:30,,Yeah so this AI is an option so to say. But you mean like cards and roleplaying or whatever.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
224,0:42:45,,But it also depends on what kind of money or whatever you have in the school. We're not really making it though.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
225,0:42:52,There was this game that reminds me of that with the cards is.. It was a very fairy-taleish game 'dixit'.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
226,0:43:11,,"And then the results, you don't share them with the class I think..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
227,0:43:15,Until you play the game,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
228,0:43:17,,"I don't want the moment of the end of the fairytale, that it's like the moral stuff..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
229,0:43:25,"No no no, but in the game there is a goal that all of the characters should work on.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
230,0:43:35,"It's maybe rebuilding the building, remaking the …",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
231,0:43:41,,"So it's just winning the game, you're not gonna have sharing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
232,0:43:46,,"So it's not overly moral, because that is going to be the moment I'm going to make fun of you.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
233,0:43:57,,"Like if I'm the guy that is playing the game and I'm playing it alone, or maybe I'm playing it in a group of three or whatever. Then I want to keep it small for this idea for the group dynamic",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
234,0:44:10,,So I wouldn't make it in a way that I give the space to make fun of things.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

236,0:44:23,,What alltogether?,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years

293,0:57:30,[presentation] So based on our assignment we realised that there is a power imbalance between the one that is bullied and the one that bullies. Because the one that bullies kind of feels empowered through bullying.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
294,0:57:44,"But there's a small nuance we think, because actually he is the one that is empowered but he's making it it through letting someone else..",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
295,0:57:57,,in the spotlight.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
296,0:58:00,And we want to kind of..,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
297,0:58:03,,"We want to keep that so the idea is that, here it says how to change the bully behaviour. And we don't really want to change the bully behaviour, but kind of change the outcome of the behaviour.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
298,0:58:16,,"So because we think it is easier in the sense that if I'm scared bully, it's this thing of like shifting the power so if I'm not focusing on me, I'm feeling empowered because I'm making you feel in the center of attention. So there is kind of this sense of like I'm not putting myself in the middle of it.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
299,0:58:36,,"And it's really hard to change that so we think we found a solution to use that, but then come out in a positive thing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
300,0:58:46,"And how we do it is basically people, the children that are in the same class, are going to write down their differences, their personal differences on a wall. And then getting inspired from those differences there will be a game.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
301,0:59:06,"We didn't really specify how the medium of the game will be. It can be like cards, or it can be a gameboard thing, it can be a VR glasses. It's up to the government let's say.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
302,0:59:19,"There will be a game design, and children are going to basically roleplay through having a different characteristic from someone else in the classroom and then they will be that person.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
303,0:59:38,,"But it's not being that person, it's having that thing.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
304,0:59:43,"Yeah and in the game there will be something that you can do the best, so this obese guy can splash more water.",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
305,0:59:53,,"And I mean more water, so all the kids are going to do it, but it's that kid that can do it best.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
306,0:59:58,,So basically kind of like using these differences or this mocked characteristic to get like the positive outcome.,,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
307,1:00:09,,"And also like before there were like two parts to it, the one was stop the bullying behaviour and the other was to be informative. So by putting the list we kind of want like a moment where without saying we're going to have this moment where we study obesity, but basically it's going to be a moment where we going through what it means to be dyslexic or whatever.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
308,1:00:43,,"So that people can understand there are also activities that can be done. So it's a loop, plus we see this as something that happens repeatedly, as the bullying. So as something that happens over a longer period of time and happens repeatedly. So at one point it's actually going to be that you have to come up with differences that you haven't thought of.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
309,1:01:14,,"So it's kind of like also exploring yourselve a bit more, and maybe you find things that I got the same as you.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
310,1:01:23,And I also think that from the thing that you said about stopping and informing. I think it is somehow stopping or diminishing through informing.,,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
311,1:01:37,,"So we're shifting the focus, we are still doing that but in the sense that I'm not changing the action ..",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
312,1:01:53,"Well actually we are changing the action, you are not bullying anyone..",,,,,,anecdotal information,Y.,Female,24,0 to 1 year
313,1:01:55,,"Yeah you are not bullying anyone but I'm saying that the action, like we identified has a typical behaviour, so the shifting the focus, the spotting the differences that is still there, but then in a positive way.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
314,1:02:10,,"And I think it is rewarding, so it's still empowering and everything because it's a game.",,,,,anecdotal information,C.,Female,27,1 to 5 years
