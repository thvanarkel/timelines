74,0:15:55,,I think the reasons to..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
75,0:16:08,,So I think that's all the reasons that we can come up with in an hour..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
76,0:16:14,,"So where: school, around campus..",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year

92,0:18:41,I think..,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
93,0:18:47,,And I [reads from paper] like who is involved?,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year

97,0:19:25,,Ok it could be classmates as well right?,manipulation1,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
98,0:19:31,"So is it always about who is strong, the leader? And the weak?",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
99,0:19:55,,I think that is it.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
100,0:19:58,,So what kind of form?,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
101,0:20:01,,"So like is bullying a collective behaviour or it's just a between you and me, an individual behaviour?",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
102,0:20:11,"So I think it is between the classmates, I think it is much more in the form of collective behaviour, because I think that they are kind of like at the same level.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
103,0:20:25,"Like you and me, but if the high grade student..",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years

108,0:21:03,,Aah among classmates,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
109,0:21:07,,But is that why it happens more in the high grades,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
110,0:21:09,"I'm not sure if it's more but because I think like two classmates like you and me, we are kind of at the same level.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
111,0:21:22,But if I'm going to bully you I have to make me feel like much more strong. So maybe I need like more people to support me.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
112,0:21:36,"And I think there is a class, like a social class there.",,manipulation1,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
113,0:21:43,There is like a power class.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years

115,0:21:48,"Yes a hierarchy, the power hierarchy.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
116,0:21:51,,So that's a why.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
117,0:21:56,So we can write down why there's hierarchy.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
118,0:21:58,,Like a school hierarchy.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
119,0:22:01,Kind of yes.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
120,0:22:05,,I think it is kind of like a power..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
121,0:22:19,So how much time do we have?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
122,0:22:22,,So we have five minutes for brainstorming,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
123,0:22:26,,So it also means that a lot of students who are being bullied are not willing to tell,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
124,0:22:45,[reads from brief] I think it is about how can we ensure that children at primary schools who bully change their behaviour.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
125,0:22:50,So I think we are going to change the behaviour of the one who bullies.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
126,0:23:12,"So maybe we can focus on the why, the reasons?",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
127,0:23:20,,"Yeah but as I see it the reasons is how is more like, the path towards the design.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
128,0:23:30,,Because what we are doing now is just breaking down the how bully is going on at this moment to better understand the context.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
129,0:23:43,,Now we can narrow it down to scope it further for brainstorming.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
130,0:23:51,But [from brief] our goal is to change the behaviour..,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
131,0:23:55,,So we need to find the target group first.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
132,0:23:58,No the target group is the student who bully others.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
133,0:24:03,,So the culprit is the..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
134,0:24:07,Ah yes.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
135,0:24:12,"I think like here is the main reason why they do behaviour like that, and we want to change their behaviour so maybe we can change their feeling.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
136,0:24:33,"Like if they feel they are like unconfident, maybe we could make them more confident.",,regression2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
137,0:24:42,,"So it comes to the reasons why they doing it, first we need to understand that..",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
138,0:24:48,What do you mean?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
139,0:24:50,,"If we are going to like design something, or find some solution to persuade this culprits not to bully others, first we need to understand why they are doing this and then we need to find approaches.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
140,0:25:05,"Yes I mean like the where is not that important. So I think like for example if their lack of empathy with the victims, maybe we could design something that would make them feel like being bullied.",,regression2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
141,0:25:26,"And if they have a lack of confidence, maybe we could design something that will make them more confident.",,regression2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
142,0:25:35,So you don't need to get your confidence by bullying others.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
143,0:25:56,,"So what I understand from what you just said is that there are a lot of positive reasons on what they are gaining by bullying, so we need to change the positive effects when they are bullying and transform it into a negative one.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
144,0:26:16,,So that they are not willing to do it anymore.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
145,0:26:21,"Not really, I mean that's part of it. We can also change the negative to the positive that would encourage them not to bully.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
146,0:26:40,"And I think this is the negative factor, lack of confidence.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
147,0:26:53,And maybe we could like let them feel powerful or confident in other ways.,,regression2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
148,0:27:04,,Make them feel powerful..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
149,0:27:06,"How about if we let them feel having others, make them feel confident or powerful maybe we they would help others instead of bully others.",,regression2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
150,0:27:19,,That could work.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
151,0:27:21,,Based on an assumption.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
152,0:28:17,Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
153,0:28:30,,"So let's do the ideation, for like fifteen minutes. Let's take fifteen minutes for brainstorming.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
154,0:28:41,,And then pick one and further develop it for like ten minutes and then we fill in the form.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year

185,0:34:20,,So that's the way how we can bridge the communication in an anonymous way between the culprit and the victims.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
186,0:34:38,"I think it is more important to convey their feelings, for the victims.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
187,0:34:53,,I think could also just be a box,manipulation2,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
188,0:34:56,"And also mayb it could be like a wish pool, like the victims can write down their dreams and wishes and throw it into the pool.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
189,0:35:20,Then students can help them to achieve his dream?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
190,0:35:33,,"So a secret box, and then can provide a pool..",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
191,0:35:46,,We can guide them to feel what happens.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
192,0:35:49,And I think the culprit is kind of like a victim to some extent.,,manipulation1,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
193,0:35:59,"Because they are like of the sense of safety, and like of the same of confidence so they are going to bully others.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
194,0:36:08,So maybe they are also the one who is not good. So their behaviour is like that.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
195,0:36:18,As in they are not really meant to do that.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
196,0:36:21,"I mean the culprit maybe does it because they are not feeling good, because maybe he has a bad experience like maybe some violence in his family.",,regression1,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
197,0:36:37,So maybe he could be the victim as well.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
198,0:36:41,But he doesn't know how to like get rid of it. So just do that.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
199,0:36:52,"So I think this is a secret box, maybe. For both the victim and the culprit.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
200,0:37:00,,Yes there also more students in one class.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
201,0:37:02,"And I think then what's what happens afterward, after this they do their form into the box.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
202,0:37:18,,There could be a lecture or a new class where people just share these things.,manipulation2,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
203,0:37:26,"No I think it's not that good, properly.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
204,0:37:32,,"So maybe afterwards there probably, these victims probably wouldn't put anything inside anymore.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
205,0:37:38,I think this should be secret but let others know their feelings.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
206,0:37:46,,"There will be some privacy issues with, there will be people reading it.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
207,0:37:52,,So what if we get some other ideas.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
208,0:37:56,,Let's get some more and then..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
209,0:38:00,I think we could just improve..,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
210,0:38:06,,Just thinking what we had.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
211,0:38:08,,So it's more like a collective thing..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
212,0:38:24,,I think that is true [points at drawing] because you say there could be a leader in one group. Who are bullying.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
213,0:38:34,,The victims.. Actually there are a lot of people who are just following..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
214,0:38:39,,"So what if there are more people, more students following the leader..",manipulation1,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
215,0:38:47,And maybe he just knows them. Because many people are following because they do not want to be bullied.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
216,0:38:56,,"I think probably not, probably it's just because there is just a chance that they are going to follow him, that's just human nature.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
217,0:39:07,Well I think it is also really the power thing.. Right? The Hierarchy.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
218,0:39:19,"So I think, what do you think?",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
219,0:39:39,"Think we can just choose one thing, because we don't have that much time.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
220,0:40:02,,"Ok, let's vote.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
221,0:40:05,"Vote haha, with just two people.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
222,0:40:11,"I think this is a [points at tree], positive way.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
223,0:40:15,And this is kind of a negative way [points at box],,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
224,0:40:19,"And I think, or maybe we could combine these two.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
225,0:40:30,I'm not sure if you read a card like a victim described that he's feeling bad because they laughed at me.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
226,0:40:41,"And then there is a victim day, the teacher can still invite them to experience the feeling of that student.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
227,0:40:59,,So probably it can still be something that for instance we have a sign 'are you bullied',manipulation2,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
228,0:41:13,"Or maybe not bullied, like or something like are you feeling good or bad or some experience like bad experience.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
229,0:41:31,,Most of them would then probably not be related to school bullying.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
230,0:41:39,,So I think probably like we can just create like a victim day to let students richer experiences.,manipulation2,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
231,0:41:50,"Or maybe not the bullying of victim day, but experience exchange day.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
232,0:41:59,,Exchange day I think.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
233,0:42:07,Just exchange day.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
234,0:42:11,,Or like role exchange day.,manipulation2,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
235,0:42:20,What do you mean with role here? Like you identify if someone is the culprit or the victim.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
236,0:42:34,I'm not sure if that is a good idea.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
237,0:42:37,"It should be something which is much more appropriate, like experiencing in general.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
238,0:42:44,So I think we can use [points at drawing in bottom-left],,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
239,0:42:47,,"And we can collect some stories, and then create this experience.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
240,0:42:58,Like everyone can put his experience form into this box and the teachers can pick one and ask students to experience this kind of thing.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
241,0:43:23,,"So an anonymous box, collecting this feedbacks.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
242,0:43:39,,So experience exchange day,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
243,0:44:00,And then teacher picks one or two,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
244,0:44:27,,"But then if we can let them exchange, we are going to have multiple stories, multiple feedbacks.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
245,0:44:37,,So we take like two?,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
246,0:44:39,"I don't know maybe three or four, doesn't matter?",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
247,0:44:44,"Several, like some story.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
248,0:44:53,"And like let the student play, roleplay game.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
249,0:45:14,But how can we be sure that the one who experience this likeâ€¦ What if the one who is in this room is the victim already.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
250,0:46:01,,So we can ask students to choose what they want to experience.. Right.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
251,0:46:04,,"Because if a victim's, for instance we are going to ask students, we're not sure if they are a victim or not.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
252,0:46:17,,"So just let them choose whether to experience something happy, or something sad..",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
253,0:46:25,Ah that's good.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
254,0:46:27,"Oh and I think this box is maybe not only bad experiences, it could be good experiences ,or bad.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
255,0:46:42,"And maybe we could make some room, like if you write down a happy experience, you are going to experience a bad experience.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
256,0:46:52,And if you write down the bad experience than you are going to experience the happy experience.,,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
257,0:47:03,,So probably just pick two. One happy and one sad.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
258,0:47:21,"And I think maybe we could let the studentto do a roleplay game, and aks them to act out the story.",,manipulation2,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
259,0:47:45,"So if someone writes down I was bullie by students and they punched me something like, and then we can ask the students who are in the happy team to act it out.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
260,0:47:56,,Yes so performance.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
261,0:48:00,Make it a game instead of a punishment.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
262,0:48:12,,Let's just put it on the form now.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
263,0:48:22,[reads from template] describe your view on the problem.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
264,0:48:28,This is our view [points at mindmap],,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
265,0:48:31,,"Yeah but we just have to abstract it, the main idea from this mindmap.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
266,0:48:54,,"So the design is more based on the empathy one, so we can highlight that one.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
267,0:49:09,I think the culprit would bully others is mainly because of their lack of empathy with the victims.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
268,0:49:29,"Or maybe they are not feeling confident, for lack of safety.",,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
269,0:50:36,,"But before like we mentioned that the culprit could be a victim at home, but he/she is going to be a culprit at school, so there's the role of the same person is blurred.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
270,0:51:01,,"So a victim could be a culprit, that's what we have brainstormed.",,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
271,0:51:13,,So probably our view on the problem is that more likeâ€¦,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
272,0:51:43,Maybe we could just write down like it. Like maybe first is like the culprit could be the victim.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
273,0:52:01,,Yeah we just write down the insights.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
274,0:52:35,,so the boundary [starts writing] between culprit and victim is blurry.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
275,0:53:42,Primary school students lack empathy for others,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
276,0:53:58,,which should be educated at school.,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
277,0:54:20,,Describe the idea you developed text/visual,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
278,0:54:47,,So experience..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
279,0:54:49,or maybe share?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
280,0:54:52,,switch/exchange/switch,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
281,0:55:03,,experience switch day,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
282,0:55:12,,So how do we describe it?,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
283,0:55:16,I think we can just copy that?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
284,0:55:17,,[starts drawing],,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
285,1:00:57,,How does the design answer the design question?,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
286,1:01:03,,I think it's just a..,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
287,1:01:12,Provide room to express their experience and feelings.,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
288,1:01:32,,The design we proposed provides students to share their experience and feelingsâ€¦,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
289,1:03:19,Do you think there should be a discussion session afterward?,,,,,,none,Su.,Female,24,1 to 5 years
290,1:03:24,,Oke,,,,,none,Sh.,Male,23,0 to 1 year
291,1:04:17,"[presentation] Our idea is about, we provide a box to the student so they can share their story, their bad experience or their good experience into this two different boxes, anonymous way.
